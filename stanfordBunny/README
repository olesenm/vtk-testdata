The Stanford bunny meshed from a watertight surface:
http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~batty/bunny_watertight.obj

Used a remeshed surface (approx 3.5mm edge length) as the basis for
polyhedral meshing. With a small prism layer just for fun.

Cell count approx. 25k cells.

For general testing.

- wavefront obj format for the surface
- proSTAR (STAR-CD) format
- EnSight "C Binary" format
- OpenFOAM format


Note that the wavefront and proSTAR files are scaled in millimeters,
whereas the EnSight and OpenFOAM are in meters.
